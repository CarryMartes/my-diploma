## Non-Functional requirements
* The project must be completed before the 15th week.
* The project must be integrated with github.
* The project must be written in Java and Python.
* The project must work in all modern browsers.
* The project must be responsive (work well and look good on all screen sizes)

## Risks
There is a possibility that integration with github will be difficult to implement.
If it doesn’t work out, then we will have to build everything from scratch.
